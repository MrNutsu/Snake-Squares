# Snake & Squares


# 🕹️ Python Mini Games – Final Project for Code in Place

**Author:** João Pedro Blagitz Ravache  
**Course:** [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) – Stanford University  
**Year:** 2025  

## 📌 About

This is my final project for Stanford's *Code in Place* course. It’s a simple Python console application featuring **two classic games**:

- **Tic-Tac-Toe (Jogo da Velha)** – Play against another player or against the computer.
- **Snake** – A terminal-based version of the arcade classic, fully playable with keyboard controls on Windows.

The project demonstrates core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, lists, functions, and basic input/output, all written in pure Python.

## 🎮 Games Included

### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe
- 3x3 grid game with turn-based logic.
- Two modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer.
- Simple AI for the computer opponent.
- Detects win conditions and draws.

### 2. Snake
- Snake moves and grows when eating fruit.
- Collision detection with walls and self.
- Score tracking.
- Uses `msvcrt` for real-time key reading (Windows only).

## 🖥️ Running the Project

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Terminal or command prompt

### How to Run
```bash
python main.py
```

Or, if you saved the file with a different name:
```bash
python your_filename.py
```

> 📝 On **Linux/macOS**, keyboard controls in the Snake game are not interactive due to system limitations, but the game still demonstrates functionality.

## 📁 File Structure

```
.
├── main.py         # Main Python file with both games
└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## ✨ Features
- Terminal screen-clearing for better UI experience.
- Cross-platform support with Windows focus.
- Modular code design with functions for each game component.
- Simple yet fun console games fully implemented in Python.

## 🧠 Learnings

This project was a great opportunity to:
- Apply foundational Python skills in a creative way.
- Work with terminal-based interfaces.
- Understand and handle user input and game state.
